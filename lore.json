{"script":"My name is Niko Oneshot. I'm about 8 years old. \n My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. \n I work as a daughter  for my mom , and i eat pancakes every day at 6 PM at the latest. \n I don't smoke, and do not drink. \n I'm in bed by 8 PM, and make sure I get ten hours of sleep, no matter what. \n After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. \n Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. \n I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. \n I'm trying to explain that I'm just a person and not a cat who wishes to live a very quiet life. \n I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. \n That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. \n Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."}
